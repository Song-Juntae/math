Differential Equations : 

A differential equation is a mathematical equation for an unknown function of one or several variables relating:

(1): The values of the function itself

(2): Its derivatives of various orders.

Dynamical System : A dynamical system is a **non-linear system** in which **a function** describes **the time dependence** of a point in **a geometrical space.**

Flow : In a dynamical system, a set of time-dependent equations is known as flow.
