# Abstract Algebra

Abstract algebra is a branch of mathematics which studies **algebraic structures** and **algebraic systems**.

It can be roughly described as the study of sets equipped with operations.

## Definitions

Mathematical System : A mathematical system is a set $S=(E,O,A)$ where: \
$E$ is a non-empty set of elements \
$O$ is a set of relations and operations on the elements of $E$ \
$A$ is a set of axioms concerning the elements of $E$ and $O$

Algebraic System : An algebraic system is a mathematical system $S=(E,O)$ where: \
$E$ is a non-empty set of elements \
$O$ is a set of finitary operations on $E$
