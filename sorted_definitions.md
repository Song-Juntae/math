## object 

객체

An object is a thing.

Everything that can be talked about in mathematics and logic can be referred to as an object.

## Distinct

서로 다른

Two objects $x$ and $y$ are distinct if and only if $x≠y$.

If $x$ and $y$ are distinct, then that means they can be distinguished, or identified as being different from each other.
